= 2. Ad-Hoc Commands

== ☑️ Ad-hoc commands

For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad-hoc commands to help
you get a feel for how Ansible works. Ansible ad-hoc commands enable you
to perform tasks on remote nodes without having to write a playbook.
They are very useful when you simply need to do one or two things
quickly, to many remote nodes.

 

=== Steps

. To start, we will need to go to our Inventory. So click *Inventories*
on the left panel, and then click the name of our Inventory *Workshop Inventory*. Now that you are on the Inventory Details page, we
will need to go select our Host. So click *HOSTS*.

Next to each host is a checkbox. Check the box next to each host you
want to run an ad-hoc Command on. Select the *Run Command* button.

This will pop up the *Run Command* window. From here is where we
can run a single task against our hosts.

Let’s start with something really basic - pinging a host. The `win_ping`
module makes sure our windows hosts are responsive. This is not a
traditional *ping*, but actually verifying both connectivity and
authentication to the host.

Fill out this form as follows:

[
[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Key | Value | Note
| Module | `win_ping` |
| Arguments | | Intentionally blank
| Limit | | This should display the host you selected in the previous step
|===

Click the *Next* button.

[
[cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===
| Key | Value | Note
| Execution environment | Windows Workshop Execution Environment |
|===

Click the *Next* button.

[
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Key | Value | Note
| Machine credential | Windows Credential |
|===

Once you click *FINSIH* you will be redirected to the Job log. Every
job and action in Automation Controller is recorded and stored. These logs can also be exported automatically to another
logging system such as Splunk or ELK.

The output tab is shown by default. Any output generated by the task is displayed here.

The details tab shows information on when the task was executed, by whom, with what credential and what hosts were affected.

The results returned will be different depending on which module is
used, as they all handle and deal with different data sets depending on
the task. No matter which module is used, you will always see a color
coded STATUS of either SUCCESS, FAILURE, CHANGED, or SKIPPING.

 

. We will now take a look at your Windows node configuration. The `setup` module queries the remote host for various data and returns that data as Ansible facts. This data is useful to determine things such as operating system version, hardware configuration, among other data points. This can then be used in your playbook for all sorts of reasons such as determining whether a task should even run, or determining what the name of a package should be based upon the operating system version.

The `setup` module will run automatically at the beginning of every playbook, unless configured not to, so that this data is always available to your playbook.

Lets go ahead and run the `setup` module to look at the output. Fill out the *RUN COMMAND* form again with this info.

[
[cols="1,1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Key | Value | Note
| Module | `setup` |
| Arguments | | Intentionally blank
| Limit | | This should display the host you selected in the previous step
|===

Click the *Next* button.

[
[cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===
| Key | Value | Note
| Execution environment | Windows Workshop Execution Environment |
|===

Click the *Next* button.

[
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Key | Value | Note
| Machine credential | Windows Credential |
| | |
|===

You should see output like this:
 
+
image::2-adhoc-run-setup-output.png[Setup Log Details,link=self]

(NOTE: If you click the three dots shown on line 21 in the above output, you will see all the facts returned by the `setup` module.)

 

. Now, let’s reset the local admin account with the `win_user` module. Our arguments parameter is going to get a little more complex now.


[
[cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|===
| Key | Value | Note
| Module | `win_user` |
| Arguments | `name=administrator password=Ansible123!` |
| Limit | | This should display the host you selected in the previous step
|===

Click the *Next* button.

[
[cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===
| Key | Value | Note
| Execution environment | Windows Workshop Execution Environment |
|===

Click the *Next* button.

[
[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Key | Value | Note
| Machine credential | Windows Credential |
|===

You will notice that the log text is now orange. This is to denote that a change was made on the system versus the green that shows that no changes were made earlier.

=== End Result

Ad-hoc commands may be useful to run once in a while. However, as automation continues to grow within an environment, they are used less and less often. In the IIS example above, this could have (should have) been written out in a playbook instead of executed through a laborious series of ad-hoc commands. This interaction with ad-hoc commands seems to mimic running individual commands from a CLI. Additional exercises will really make this clear.
