A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an
Ansible job. Job templates are useful to execute the same job many
times.

== ☑️ Syncing your Project

Before you can create a job template with a new playbook, you must first
sync your Project so that Controller knows about it. To do this, visit Controller, click
*Projects* under *Automation Execution* and then click the sync icon next to your project. Once
this is complete, you can create the job template.

. When the job has successfully completed, navigate to your `windows` tab. This is your Windows host. Open Microsoft Edge from the Windows desktop and navigate to: http://localhost

== ☑️ Extra Credit

Now that you have IIS Installed, create a new playbook called
*remove_iis.yml* to stop and remove IIS.

*Hint:* First stop the `W3Svc` service using the `win_service` module,
then delete the `Web-Server` service using the `win_feature` module.
Optionally, use the `win_file` module to delete the index page.
