A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an
Ansible job. Job templates are useful to execute the same job many
times.

== ☑️ Syncing your Project

Before you can create a job template with a new playbook, you must first
sync your Project so that Controller knows about it. To do this, visit Controller, click
*Projects* and then click the sync icon next to your project. Once
this is complete, you can create the job template.

== ☑️ Running the Template

Now that you’ve successfully created your Job Template, you are ready to
launch it. Once you do, you will be redirected to a job screen which is
refreshing in real time showing you the status of the job.

=== Step 1

Select TEMPLATES.

=== Step 2

Click the rocketship icon image:../assets/at_launch_icon.png[Launch] for the *IIS Basic Job Template*.

Sit back, watch the magic happen.

Once again you should be presented with a Job log page. Selecting the *Details* tab should show you the variable you passed into the playbook among other details.

Next you will be able to see details on the play and each task in the
playbook.

=== Step 7

When the job has successfully completed, navigate to your `windows` tab. This is your Windows host. Open Microsoft Edge from the Windows desktop and navigate to: http://localhost

If all went well, you should see something like this, but with your own
custom message of course.

== ☑️ Extra Credit

Now that you have IIS Installed, create a new playbook called
*remove_iis.yml* to stop and remove IIS.

*Hint:* First stop the `W3Svc` service using the `win_service` module,
then delete the `Web-Server` service using the `win_feature` module.
Optionally, use the `win_file` module to delete the index page.
